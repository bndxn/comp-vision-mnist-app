# comp-vision-mnist-app
An app which receives fashion-mnist images and returns the class

* Fashion MNIST data set on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)
* The [README](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) for Fashion MNIST argues this dataset is too easy
* So instead using Caltech dataset
* Pytorch model taken from Pytorch quickstart [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)
* FastAPI

## Potential extensions

* Squirrel spotter? Train on this dataset: [Squirrel images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harrybaines/squirrels)
* Could also combine with langchain! Getting a bit ahead of myself maybe
